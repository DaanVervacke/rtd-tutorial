These docs will explain how to set-up a Home Assistant instance with seamless support for:

* ESP32 & ESP8266 microcontrollers
* Python scripts

This will allow us to:

* Configure ESP8266/ESP32 microcontrollers by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Assistant.
* Write Python functions and scripts that can implement a wide range of Home Assistant automation, logic and triggers.  


This guide requires basic knowledge about:

* Linux & Bash
* `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_
* `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`_
* ESP32 GPIO pins

It's recommend to follow the table of contents order, **step by step**.

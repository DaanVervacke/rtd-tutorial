Setting up ESPHome
=========================

.. _esphomeinstallation:

Installing ESPHome Container
----------------------------

Open up your favourite terminal. We'll start by pulling the ESPHome Docker image.

.. code:: bash

   docker pull ghcr.io/esphome/esphome

Connect your ESP32/ESP8266 to your device via USB.

Now letâ€™s setup a configuration file. 
Fortunately, ESPHome has a friendly setup wizard that will guide you through creating your first configuration file. 
For example, if you want to create a configuration file called ``myfirstconfig.yaml``:

.. code:: bash

   docker run \
   --rm \
   -v "${PWD}":/config \
   -it ghcr.io/esphome/esphome \
   wizard \
   myfirstconfig.yaml

.. _esphomeconfiguration:

If all goes well you'll be greated by this screen:
